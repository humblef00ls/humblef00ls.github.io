        <h1 style="" class="abh">Hi! Im Aparimeya Taneja, a UI/UX and web designer, and fullstack developer.</h1>
        <p class="aboot"> Currently, I am a CS major at Duke University. This is my personal website [Space themed!]
            where you can see my resume as well as almost all other big and small projects i've worked on.
            I am also a freelance graphic designer and sometimes make digital art [@Humblef00ls] for fun!
        </p>
        <p class="abuut"> I was born in New Delhi, India, and have been coding for about 4 years now, but my love for
            computers and tech comes from an entire childhood worth of video games and anime. For me, design and user
            experience are just as important as the inner mechanics of anything. Working on projects small and large,
            i've
            learnt many skills that compliment designing, be it as simple yet esssential like color schemes, to more
            technical ones like rapid prototyping, how to optimally use IDEs and git, and many more.</p>

 <h1 style="margin: 0px;">Sky_Vault</h1>
<hr>
    <p>
       Sky_Vault is the first back end web app I ever made. It is a simple and free text archiving platform, where you
        can upload/type/paste any text up to 2000 characters, and assign it a password/key, which is what then further
        encrypts your stored text.<br><br> I really was just bored one day and thought this would be cool way to archive and share
        texts.<br><br>
        The whole backend was made in PHP7, and Sky_Vault2.0 will be coming soon [In Node.JS this time!].

    <h1 style="margin: 0px;">Humblef00ls</h1>

    <p>
        Humblef00ls is basically my digital/designer alias, but mainly the name of my page on instagram
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/humblef00ls/"style="font-weight: 300"  target="_blank">[@humblefools]</a>.<br><br>
        I started it as just a place where I would upload the designs I used to make whenever I was bored back in 2017.
        Now, it has over 1200 followers, and has been a great platform/brand/digital identity for me to showcase
        my skills and has even gotten me several freelance commissions.

    <h1 style="margin: 0px;">The Columban</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        I was the editor in chief as well as the design head of my school's annual magazine, 'The Columban'. My job
        included managing 18 other students as well as designing most and reviewing all pages of the magazine. <br><br>It
        was my first huge project, which also had the largest learning curve, from photoshop skills and efficiency to
        leadership and team management.

    <h1 class="closure">x</h1>
    <h1 style="margin: 0px;">Columban Fest</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Was the designer and the sole web developer for my school's annual cultural fest event, the Columban Fest for two years.
         This was the first time I fully designed a dynamic and mobile friendly website, and even had a php form in it's second edition.
        <br><br>
        Although I no longer pay for the website's hosting, you can check out their current page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cfest18"style="font-weight: 300"  target="_blank">here</a>.

    <hr>
    <p>
      Was the director and main video editor for my school's graduation film for the batch of 2017. Although I don't really
        like AV Editing, it was really fun to make and took about 50+ hours in total.<br><br>
        Watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvpsXK2xSbU"style="font-weight: 300"  target="_blank">here</a>.

    <h1 style="margin: 0px;">Columban MUN</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Was the USG IT Head for my school's MUN conference. This was really just majorly only graphic design with some
        other tech-related assistance to the secretariat of The Columban Model United Nations Conference 2017. I had to
        design basically everything [Logo, placards, stationary, etc.] from scratch since this was the first MUN hosted by our school in this decade.<br><br>

    <hr>
    <p>
        Was part of a team project, with the role of a graphic designer and web front end developer. To be honest, I learned
        a lot more about professional level team work and management, as well as market research and rapid prototyping with XD
        over more tech related skills.

    <p>
        Was the sole developer, designer and also tech-advisor for a business startup. This was my first professional project
        that I carried out alone over the summer.<br><br>
        It was a great learning curve as I figured out and deployed several essential strategies that web based businesses use such
        as SEO, data analytics, etc. I also gained a lot of technological experience working with a PHP backend for their Database,
        registration, and other features.<br><br>
